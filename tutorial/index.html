        RabbitMQ, Actors, Streams and Message Processing Rules - An Activator Seed Template
    </title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a seed template which exposes the building blocks for a distributed system in which components communicate
            via a message broker (rabbitmq) and process messages using akka streams.
            A very simple rule engine is included - it plays a role in deciding the next steps after messages are processed.
            The implementation is provided in both scala and java.
        </p>
        <p>The template should be useful in building systems for batch processing that are designed around a workflow where
            information has to be passed around all the nodes so that each can augment it with specifics.
        </p>
        <p>Each node can scale by making use of akka streams. The message broker provides connectivity between the nodes and
            allows to keep the business logic for each node to a minimum - thus paving the way for the system to adhere to
            the SOC principle.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            We'll connect to a RabbitMQ server by using a <a href="https://github.com/sstone/amqp-client">Scala AMQP client</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll forward messages we receive on a queue to an actor that acts as an Akka Streams Source for our messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            We process the messages with Akka Streams by passing the messages through a set of <a href="http://www.easyrules.org/">rules</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
            You'll have to <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">set up</a> RabbitMQ server.
            Also, install the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html">management plugin</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create a <code>rabbitmq-akka-actors</code> persistent queue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Configure the connection to the RabbitMQ service by editing the <a href="#code/src/main/resources/application.conf">configuration file</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Connecting to RabbitMQ</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://github.com/sstone/amqp-client">AMPQ client library</a> we're using models message handlers as Akka actors.
            The messages we get from a RabbitMQ queue will be handled by an Akka actor.
        </p>
        <p>
            We connect to the RabbitMQ server using the <code>setUpRabbit</code> method of the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/tpg/rabbit/RabbitConn.scala">RabbitConn</a>
            object.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>handler</code> parameter is the actor that will handle the messages we receive.
            For the Scala version, this handler is implemented in the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/tpg/pnode/ListenerActor.scala">ListenerActor.scala</a> file.
            For the Java version, in the <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/tpg/nnode/ListenerActor.java">ListenerActor.java</a> file.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Building a stream source</h2>
        <p>
            We create a stream source from the messages we receive from RabbitMQ. This source is an actor that will receive two kind of messages - from
            a RabbitMQ queue but also from the stream.
            The messages we receive from the stream system are requests to provide more elements for processing.
            Thus in this actor we have to build a buffering mechanism that will balance the amount of RabbitMQ messages and the requests for more elements we have from the stream.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Scala implementation for this actor is in the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/tpg/pnode/rabbit/RabbitQueueSourceActor.scala">RabbitQueueSourceActor.scala</a> file.
            For the Java version see <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/tpg/nnode/rabbit/RabbitQueueSourceActor.java">RabbitQueueSourceActor.java</a>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Message processing rules</h2>
        <p>
            This seed template makes use of the <a href="http://www.easyrules.org/">Easy Rules</a> library to illustrate message processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rules are set up in the <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/tpg/pnode/rules/package-info.java">rules package</a>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/tpg/pnode/ProcessingApp.scala">ProcessingApp.scala</a> and
            <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/tpg/nnode/ProcessingApp.java">ProcessingApp.java</a> contain the entry point
            in our small application.
        </p>
        <p>
            We connect to the RabbitMQ server, instantiate our RabbitMQ and stream source actors;
            we build the set of rules to process our messages. In the final step, we process the akka stream we set up.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Run <a href="#code/src/main/scala/com/tpg/pnode/ProcessingApp.scala">ProcessingApp.scala</a> or
            <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/tpg/nnode/ProcessingApp.java">ProcessingApp.java</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Go to RabbitMQ's management <a href="http://localhost:15672/#/queues/%2F/rabbitmq-akka-actors">console page for the queue</a> you created
            and start posting messages. The application should show signs of activity by printing information on the screen.
            A <code>peek-a-boo</code> message should trigger the <a href="#code/src/main/java/com/tpg/pnode/rules/PasswordRule.java">password rule</a>.
        </p>
